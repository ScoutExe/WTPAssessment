        <p>I have been involved in scouting since I was a baby. I first went camping when I was less than 1 year old
            as my parents where part of the service team at the time. Through my scouting I have done many strange
            and exciting things including going to Norway and swimming accross a lake there, to working backstage at
            a <a href="https://cc.newcastledistrictscouts.org.uk/"><em><strong>Gang Show</strong></em></a> once a year.</p>
